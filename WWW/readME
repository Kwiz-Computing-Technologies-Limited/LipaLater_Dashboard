Case Study Queries:

Based on the provided Data,
- create a dashboard 
 (a) an overview of the provided data and recommendations to influence strategy
 (b) Rank the products (Phones, Fridges, Tablets etc) based on the repayments- best to least performing
 (c) Analyse the performance of repeat clients
 (d) Detail the performance based on the disbursed months
 (e) In your understanding, segment the data into the main clusters

Metrics:
Collections Rate: Amount Collected against the Expected Amount




WHAT I HAVE IMPLEMENTED:
____________________________
* calculated ("Collections Rate") repayment rate as:
    "Total Repayment Derived (Amount Collected)" as % of "Total Expected Repayment Derived (Expected Amount)"
    
* aggregated this % to find mean repayment % for "products (Item Type)" and all the other ranking variables implemented

NOTE: Assumption that for multiple item puchases, monthly payments cover each items proportionately:
      * group the data by:
       - client ID
       - Submitted On Date
       - Principal Disbursed Derived
       
    and calculate 
      - "item price" out of "total price paid for multiple item purchases".
      
      * Use this proportion to adjust the item values for:
        - arrears amount
        - principal/interest/fee disbursed
        - principal/interest/fee repaid
        - principal/interest/fee outstanding
        - total expected repayment
        - total repayment derived)

1. overview of the provided data and recommendations to influence strategy (TAB: "Overview")
    The user:
    - selects all or specific product to view and obtains summary with:
        - Total loan amount disbursed
        - Number of clients disbursed to
        - Number of Partner stores
        - Returns obtained 
        - Returns expected

    - Ranks "Brands" for the selected products by "sales frequency" or "sales amount (revenue)"
    - Visualizes Patner Stores from which buyers have accrued largest arrears (on the selected product)
    - Visualizes and gets a comment on the Relationship between the "arrears days" and the "arrears amount" (on the selected product)
    - Visualizes the distributions of both "Arrears Days" and "Arrears Amount" separately
    

2. Rank:  (TAB: "Performance")
    - the products (Phones, Fridges, Tablets etc) [REQUIRED]
    - other features (Brand, Partner stores, client location, referral source and disbursed Months) [ADDITIONAL]
    
  Best to least performing Based on:
    - the repayment rates  [REQUIRED]
    - sales frequency [ADDITIONAL]
    - principal disbursed [ADDITIONAL]
    - Arrears accrued [ADDITIONAL]
    
3. performance of repeat clients (TAB: "Performance")
    The parragraph summarises:
    - proportion of repeat customers
    - proportion of Loans to repeat customers
    - average number of transactions per customer
    - Patners these purchases were made from
    - Average Total payouts to these partners
    - returns generated (nominal) from repeat customers
    - expected expected (nominal) from repeat customers
    
4. performance based on the disbursed months (TAB: "Performance")
    Currently selecting "Month Submitted" under "Rank By" in TAB 2, enables us rank disbursed months based on:
    - the repayment rates  
    - sales frequency 
    - principal disbursed 
    - Arrears accrued 
    
5. product clusters
    - I used K-means clustering for this. User selects:
        - features (variables) on which to cluster the data
        - The number of clusters to fit
    - the output includes:
        - cluster means for the variables fitted
        - number of product items in selected cluster
        - the products in the cluster
